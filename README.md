## 🔒 Security in Action

### Network Traffic Protection Visualization

SecureGen implements multiple security layers to protect web communications. Here's what that looks like in practice:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center" width="50%">
      <img src="assets/security/before-protection.png" alt="Before Security Layers" width="100%"/>
      <br/><b>Before: Readable HTTP Traffic</b>
      <br/>All request details visible in plaintext
    </td>
    <td align="center" width="50%">
      <img src="assets/security/after-protection.png" alt="After Security Layers" width="100%"/>
      <br/><b>After: Protected Traffic</b>
      <br/>Encrypted and obfuscated communications
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

**What Changes:**
- **Before:** API endpoints, session cookies, and request structure are fully visible to network monitoring tools
- **After:** Multi-layer protection encrypts payload, obfuscates URLs, masks metadata, and prevents traffic analysis

This demonstrates the **7-layer security architecture** protecting your sensitive data from passive monitoring, MITM attacks, and traffic pattern analysis.

<details>
<summary><b>🔍 Technical Details (Click to Expand)</b></summary>

**Protection Layers:**

1. **Key Exchange (ECDH)** - Establishes secure session keys using elliptic curve cryptography
2. **Session Encryption** - Unique encryption for each communication session
3. **URL Obfuscation** - Dynamic API endpoints generated using cryptographic hashing
4. **Header Obfuscation** - HTTP headers dynamically mapped to hide metadata
5. **Decoy Injection** - Fake headers added to confuse traffic analysis
6. **Method Tunneling** - HTTP methods hidden to prevent fingerprinting
7. **Timing Protection** - Random delays prevent timing-based side-channel attacks

**Security Benefits:**
- Protects against passive network monitoring (Wireshark, packet sniffing)
- Prevents traffic pattern analysis and metadata leakage
- Resists MITM attacks through session-based encryption
- Anti-fingerprinting measures prevent device identification

**Performance Impact:**
- ~50ms overhead per request
- Minimal impact on user experience
- Worth the trade-off for security-critical applications

**Implementation:**
- Built with mbedTLS for cryptographic primitives
- Custom session management layer
- Hardware-accelerated encryption on ESP32
- All code available in the repository for audit
